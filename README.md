mammal_data_v2 is the dataset used for reconstructions on the Meredith_2011 topology

mammal_data_v2_upham is the dataset used for reconstructions on the Upham_2019 topology

Meredith.R and Upham.R are respectivley, R scripts for reproducting analyses on the Meredith et al 2011 and Upham et al 2019 topologies, as well as their associated RData workspace objects

Analysis products are deposited inside /Meredith_output and /Upham_output
